# Power BI Logistics Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This project presents an **interactive Power BI dashboard** designed to analyze logistics operations, shipment volumes, carrier mix, and cost efficiency using anonymized data.

The dashboard allows users to explore logistics performance across multiple dimensions such as time, carrier type, density classification, warehouse type, and product group, enabling both **high-level monitoring** and **deep operational analysis**.

---

## Business Objective
The primary objective of this dashboard is to support **logistics and operations decision-making** by:

- Monitoring shipment volumes and trends over time  
- Comparing carrier types (1P vs 3P) in terms of volume and cost  
- Identifying cost drivers across density and logistics paths  
- Enabling flexible, filter-driven analysis for different business scenarios  

The dashboard is designed to answer questions such as:
- How are shipment volumes evolving over time?
- Which carrier types account for most shipments and costs?
- How do costs and volumes vary by density classification?
- Where are inefficiencies or concentration risks in the logistics network?

---

## Data
The dataset used in this project is **fully anonymized and safe to share**.
All sensitive or identifying information has been removed.

The data is included exclusively for **educational, analytical, and portfolio demonstration purposes**.

## Dashboard Structure & Pages
The Power BI report is organized into multiple interactive sections, accessible through navigation buttons:

### 🔹 Overview
- High-level KPIs for shipments and costs
- Carrier-level comparison
- Time-series view of shipment evolution

### 🔹 Logistic Path
- Analysis of shipment flows across different logistics paths
- Comparison of carrier types and shipment characteristics

### 🔹 Shipment Volume
- Volume distribution by carrier, time period, and operational dimensions
- Trend analysis with monthly and quarterly views

### 🔹 Density Analysis
- Breakdown of shipments and costs by density classification
- Comparison of 1P vs 3P performance across rural and urban areas
- Cost and volume percentage analysis

### 🔹 Time Analysis
- Shipment trends over time
- Identification of seasonal patterns and peaks

### 🔹 Company Table
- Detailed tabular view for carrier-level and operational analysis
- Designed for filtering, sorting, and drill-down exploration

Representative screenshots of the dashboard are available in the `screenshots/` folder.

## Filters & Interactivity
The dashboard includes an extensive filtering system that allows users to dynamically explore the data, including:
- Time period (month, quarter)
- Carrier type and specific carrier
- Network and warehouse type
- Density classification
- Product group
- Inventory and scheduling attributes

This design enables fast scenario analysis without modifying the underlying model.

---

## Key Insights
- Shipment volumes and logistics costs are heavily concentrated in third-party (3P) carriers
- Cost structures vary significantly across density classifications
- Time-based analysis reveals clear volume fluctuations and peak periods
- Interactive filtering enables identification of operational inefficiencies and cost drivers

Detailed insights are obtained through interactive exploration rather than static reporting.
